;; the trelloel library.

;;; Code:


(defun trelloel-oauth--get-token (application)
  (trelloel-oauth--load-token application))

(defun trelloel-oauth--token-file (application)
  (expand-file-name
   (concat user-emacs-directory application "-oauth-token")))

(defun trelloel-oauth--load-token (application)
  (let ((oauth-token-file (trelloel-oauth--token-file application)))
    (unless (file-exists-p oauth-token-file)
      (trelloel-oauth--set-token application))
    (trelloel-oauth--read-token application)))
